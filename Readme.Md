# Unit Testing

A comprehensive guide to unit testing best practices and implementation.

# What is Unit Testing?

Unit testing is a software testing method where individual units or components of software are tested in isolation to ensure they work correctly. A unit is the smallest testable part of an application.

# Benefits

- **Early Bug Detection**: Catch issues during development
- **Code Quality**: Ensures code reliability and maintainability
- **Refactoring Safety**: Provides confidence when modifying code
- **Documentation**: Tests serve as living documentation
- **Faster Development**: Reduces debugging time in later stages

# Best Practices

# 1. Test Structure
- Follow the **Arrange-Act-Assert** (AAA) pattern
- One assertion per test when possible
- Use descriptive test names

# 2. Test Coverage
- Aim for high code coverage (80%+ is generally good)
- Focus on critical business logic
- Test edge cases and error conditions

# 3. Test Independence
- Tests should not depend on each other
- Use proper setup and teardown methods
- Mock external dependencies


# Getting Started

1. Choose appropriate testing framework for your language
2. Set up test environment and configuration
3. Write your first test
4. Run tests regularly (ideally with CI/CD)
5. Maintain and update tests as code evolves
